### What I learned

As always by doing each challenge i learn something new,i think this is the first challenge using JavaScript, especially learning to use react js.

I learned about how to create a "tooltip" menu, it's not easy for me because it's my first time doing that, i spend hours trying to figure out how to make tooltip menu in react ðŸ¤£

i learned that in react there's React Portal that help element to move at the <body>, it prepends the "tooltip" cut by the parent element overflow: hidden [1]

```jsx
import ReactDom from "react-dom";

const Baloon = (props) => {
  return ReactDom.createPortal(props.children, document.body);
};

export default Baloon;
```

im also learned how to make click outside to close using react hook [2]

im still fail on positiong of the tooltip, maybe in the future i can fix it ðŸ˜…
